    <Overview>In Jurassic CSI, dino detective Dr. Phil Manning launches a full-scale investigation to unearth how dinosaurs really looked and lived.

Jurassic CSI goes into the minds, under the skin and inside the bones of the biggest, most impressive beasts ever to walk the planet. Dr. Manning doesn’t stick to convention – or even his own discipline – on his perpetual quest to expand what we know about dinosaurs. With privileged access to some of the world’s most sophisticated technologies – from crime scene 3D mapping technology to an image machine one million times stronger than a chest X-ray – Jurassic CSI challenges long – held assumptions and poses radical questions about our understanding of dinosaurs.</Overview>

    <Overview>Go inside the mind of a T. rex with Dr. Phil Manning as he examines just how the planet's ultimate predator's brain was hard wired for the kill. Tyrannosaurus Rex was notoriously small-brained did this render him a lumbering animal that killed by opportunity or could his brain possess all the right tools of a calculated hunter? With the most perfectly preserved T. rex skull ever collected, Phil employs a CT scanner to unlock the fossil's mysteries.</Overview>

    <Overview>Dinosaurs vanished from the earth millions of years ago leaving only a handful of clues to their existence, including fossils and footprints. Such scant evidence has meant that palaeontologists have always struggled to answer the question, how did the dinosaurs move? Treating fossils and footprints like crime scene evidence, Dr. Phil Manning employs cutting-edge crime scene technology in Spain to create a 3D virtual world of one of the most spectacular dino stomping grounds on the globe.</Overview>

    <Overview>What colors were dinosaurs? We know little about their actual color, and now maverick dino detective Dr. Phil Manning tries to find out more. He utilizes one of the world's most precise imaging machines which uses highly focused beams one million times stronger than a chest X-ray to search for traces of color pigments chemistry in fossils. But first, Phil uses the synchrotron on a magpie-sized bird with teeth, the archaeopteryx, and reveals tremendous detail.</Overview>

    <Overview>In the cutthroat world of the ultimate apex predators, dinosaurs suffered colossal injuries and limped through a world rife with deadly infection and diseases. How did these amazing beasts manage to thrive despite their violent surroundings? Investigating a debilitating injury on the largest T. rex ever found, where muscle and tendon were ripped from a bone, Phil creates 3-D models of the healed T. rex's arm. Remarkably, he finds that the wrecked arm bone rebuilt itself.</Overview>

    <Overview>In the quest to cover a dinosaur model with scientifically accurate skin, Dr. Phil Manning employs forensic analysis on the incredibly rare fossilized skin of a baby titanosaur. Never before have these priceless samples of fossil dinosaur embryo skin left Argentina to be studied, giving Phil the unprecedented opportunity to really get inside the skin of a dinosaur. Phil can't build his model alone, so in addition to digging up dino skin, he's unearthed a world-class model maker.</Overview>
