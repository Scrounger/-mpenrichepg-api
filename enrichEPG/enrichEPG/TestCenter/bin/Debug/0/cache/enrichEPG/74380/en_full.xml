    <Overview>Former Naval Intelligence officer Thomas Magnum resigns his commission to become a private investigator on the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii. He lands a home in the guest house on the estate of millionaire author Robin Masters in exchange for testing the estate's security, but is forced to work under the strict and ever watchful eye of Jonathan Higgins, a former British Army soldier who serves as the estate manager, and constantly patrols the grounds with his two "lads" Zeus and Apollo, who are loyally trained Doberman Pinschers always ready to pounce on Magnum. Magnum makes good use of the perks that come with working on the estate, including driving Masters' sporty red 308 GTS Ferrari, Audi, and all-terrain Jimmy, as well as equipment such as high-end cameras and telescopes.</Overview>

Magnum is hired by her former producer and lover to investigate any other men that she may have been seeing before her death â€“ a case that Magnum is reluctant to take, but, feeling guilty for not taking it before the girl was killed, he agrees. But as the investigations unfold, it becomes apparent that there is much more to the case than first appears, and the supposedly murdered woman was being hounded by the obsessive former lover...    The case reaches it's pinnacle when Magnum, still haunted by nightmares of the Vietnam war in his dreams, finds himself reliving it in much more reality, in a deadly hunt down on a deserted tropical island...</Overview>

Magnum's investigations into the case are helped by the fact that Higgins wants a favour, and is being overly nice and co-operative in return...</Overview>

    <Overview>Rick is organising a surf-ski competition to be held at the King Kamehameha Club (much to the disapproval of co-committee member Higgins) when a Kahuna appears a places a ""curse"" on the club and all who use it. Magnum and others are sceptical, but the native locals take such curses very seriously, and it seems there may be something in it when one of the competition competitors suddenly collapses and dies; then, amongst other incidents, fire breaks out in the kitchen; and when Rick falls ill. Thomas investigates to try and find if there is a more logical explanation behind the events, but his enquiries aren't helped by a hounding news reporter, who sees the series of strange incidents as a chance for a big news story...</Overview>

    <Overview>One night, Rick, feeling down after learning that a girl he was serious about is getting married, meets an attractive young woman called Sara, a beautiful woman dressed in a white vale. As the pair befriend each other, she tells him that she is being terrorised by a man named Henry Ellison, after she didn't return his feelings of love. But during a walk on the beach with the girl, she suddenly disappears, seemingly into thin air. Rick insists that Thomas look in to it, and they learn that Sara died 35 years ago, after supposedly committing suicide, though there was rumour that suggested she was murdered; and sightings of her ghost are occasionally reported. Magnum digs into both the past and present to find if there is logical explanation and if someone is impersonating Sara, or if it really was something more ethereal that Rick encountered..</Overview>

All he has of the brisk sighting is some blurred photos he managed to take, and T.C. and Rick, whilst not completely convinced, help as he scours the local area looking for her. But there are several parties that intend to see that Thomas is unable to make contact with Michelle, and the search sees them stumbling into dangerous political territory.</Overview>

    <Overview>Magnum is surprised when a beautiful English woman spurns his advances - much to the amusement of T.C. and Rick - instead preferring Higgins. Thomas is certain that the woman is feigning interest in Higgins only to somehow use him, and plans to uncover the truth, but Higgins sees his doubts as sheer jealousy, and the ever volatile relationship between the two is pushed towards breaking point. Matters aren't helped when Magnum is attacked by a sumo wrestler and a dwarf and, understandably, no-one believes him...</Overview>

With Buck to stay as a guest of Robin Master's on the Estate, she wants Thomas to keep him out of danger until she has collected the back alimony money he owes, but he may not be around to pay it if he keeps on with his dangerous antics - something which is proven when Buck makes his entrance onto the scene in a dare-devil parachute stunt - injuring Higgins in the process!

The dancer's stuboness sees sparks flying between the pair as Magnum tries to protect her - and T.C.'s previously undeclared love of ballet comes in useful, with him more than willing to help Thomas out on the case for once. Meanwhile, Rick accepts a job on Magnum's behalf, to investigate a woman's husband, but Thomas becomes suspicious that the timing of the job is rather too coincidentally and comes to suspect that he's been hired for another reason; and the whole situation sees him uncovering a case of international intrigue...</Overview>

    <Overview>Magnum returns from a case out of Honolulu, to find that the Masters Estate is being used by a film team to shoot a new movie, based on one of Robin's books. What's more, he is employed to be the stunt double for one of the film's stars, Jack Martin - something which Thomas is highly unenthusiastic about, until he learns that Martin's wife Olivia Ross, of whom Thomas has always greatly admired, is also starring in the film, and relishes the opportunity to get close to her. But things take a dramatic turn when, during filming of a key scene, Olivia shoots Jack with a prop gun, but the bullets turn out to be real instead of blanks, leaving Jack in critical condition. With his idol Olivia the prime suspect in trying to kill her husband, Magnum investigates the ""accidental"" shooting to find just how the bullets came to be changed, and by whom...</Overview>

    <Overview>First part of what was originally shown as a feature-length story. Nuzo, an old war comrade of T.C. and Magnum's, suddenly arrives in Hawaii, and finds T.C. to warn him that Colonel Ivan, a sadistic Russian agent who once held them captive and tortured them in a P.O.W. camp in Vietnam, is after them. At first, T.C. puts his old buddy's fears down to delayed stress, but it gradually begins to seem that there might be some truth in his claims. Meanwhile, Lt. MacReynolds resigns from the Navy, and Magnum lets him stay with him for a few days, but a fatal accident meant for Thomas - as yet unaware of Nuzo's warnings - adds ground to the fears that maybe Ivan is on the trail after all...</Overview>

Meanwhile, T.C. has accidentally made a double booking of Higgins and two tourists, who both want to make flights that morning, and has to compromise by taking all three of them. But the tourist pair turn out to be armed and sky-jack the chopper, and force T.C. to fly to a nearby prison for the daring break-out of an inmate. From there they head to a rendezvous point on a small nearby island,  but the damage inflicted on the helicopter during the break-out sees them crash-landing. With the Police short on leads, Thomas and Rick investigate, and the road accident that Thomas was witness to provides a key clue...</Overview>

But during the duel, Troubshaw is suddenly killed in seemingly a freak accident, when Higgins' foil sets off his hit indicator, causing him to be electrocuted. Higgins becomes suspect for murder when his fingerprints are found on the rewired scoring box. Magnum is certain that Higgins couldn't have been responsible for the killing, and sets about finding the real culprit behind the death, but the evidence and motives are stacked up against Higgins, and for some reason, he is refusing to call upon Robin Master's top lawyers and is just going along with the allegations...</Overview>

At first, Thomas thinks the whole thing is a joke, especially when the Samurai, Tozan, claims that the plate was stolen by a ninja, but the situation is for real, and the pair team up to try and find the stolen artefact. But they must work fast, as Tozan's centuries-old culture dictates that he must commit sepuku â€“ which means taking his own life â€“ if the precious plate isn't retrieved...</Overview>

    <Overview>Robin Master's mentor, Elizabeth Barrett, arrives at the estate with her macaw Merlin to research a book on ornithology. The former teacher hits it off famously with Thomas, but becomes so much of a thorn in Higgins's side that he bribes Thomas to help in bringing her visit to an expeditious end by finding Dr. Albert Tessa, the reclusive bird expert she's come to the island to interview. Thomas soon discovers that Elizabeth isn't Robin's mentor, but a K.G.B. agent on a mission to assassinate Tessa, a refugee freedom fighter from the 1956 Hungarian revolt. Meanwhile, Thomas has troubles collecting his fee from a man whose beautiful employee is tough enough to shoot out the Porsche's windscreen to keep Thomas at a distance from her boss.</Overview>

The corrupt narcotics officer who arrested Rod follows him to Hawaii and threatens to send him back to prison on trumped up charges unless Rod serves a drug courier for him. Thomas offers to help his buddy out by delivering a box of encyclopedias Rod has sold, but comes in for a rude awakening when it turns out the package was filled with dope, not books, and that Rod has shortchanged one of the biggest dealers on the island. Finding it hard to believe that his friend is a dope dealer, Thomas seeks the help of Rod's parole officer in locating him and setting up a sting to ensnare the corrupt cop and the drug dealer, thereby clearing Rod's name.</Overview>

    <Overview>Thomas is hired to follow Angie, the wife of his client Clarence, to see if she's being unfaithful. After watching Clarence in the ring training for his next title bout, Thomas is extremely reluctant to be the bearer of bad tidings. Clarence assures him that he wants proof that Angie is cheating, so that the fight's multi-million dollar purse won't be part of the settlement negotiations in the divorce proceedings she initiated. While he's on Angie's trail, Thomas meets a priest at the airport who turns out to be Higgins's Irish half-brother Paddy. Higgins isn't thrilled to see his sibling, especially when he discovers that Paddy has followed Ffolkes, Higgins's former commanding officer, to Hawaii after suspecting Ffolkes of stealing a relic during a search of Paddy's church for I.R.A. weapons. Paddy intends to hold hostage a certain English relic he pilfered from the custody of Ffolkes and Higgins until the one from his church is returned until Thomas steps in to mediate the standoff a</Overview>

    <Overview>It's the 4th of July, and Higgins is playing in a polo match, T.C. is taking his baseball team to a professional game, Rick is out with his latest girlfriend on the King Kamehameha II yacht, and Thomas is observing his annual Independence Day tradition of a solitary day at sea -- until his surf ski is capsized in the wake of a recklessly driven speedboat and set adrift. Carried off further and further away from land by the powerful Molokai Channel, Thomas relies on childhood memories of his father's training him to tread water to keep himself afloat as he struggles desperately to stay above water and fend off a menacing shark. As the hours pass, Higgins, T.C. and Rick each have a sixth sense that Thomas is in trouble, and they team up to rescue him. Thomas approaches the twenty-four hour mark in the water recalling his wedding to Michelle and his father's burial -- on July 4, 1951 -- as Higgins scoops him out of the ocean, with T.C. in his helicopter overhead and Rick on the yacht near</Overview>

She is in the islands incognito, and must sell some valuable family jewels after being strapped financially, but Higgins ends up saving her from two men who accost her in an alleyway. As smitten with the woman as ever, Higgins offers her a job on the Estate, and plans to reveal his feelings towards her via a letter, but due to a mix-up and misunderstanding, she assumes the letter to be from Thomas instead, whom it becomes apparent she has eyes for, blind to Higgins' desires. But these confused matters of the heart seem trivial when the Duchess is kidnapped by the two men who had made a grab for her previously...</Overview>

    <Overview>As he continues his memoirs, Higgins recalls the spring of 1976, when old friend from Sandhurst, David Worth, arrives in Honolulu to attend the funeral of a mutual friend. Insisting that his name is Stanley Sigerson, Sherlock Holmes's most frequently used alias, and that Higgins is Watson, Holmes's faithful friend, David firmly believes that their friend was murdered  by none other than Moriarty, Sherlock Holmes's arch-nemesis. In the name of friendship, Higgins indulges David  in his investigation, even though his suspicion that David is insane is borne out, and is shocked to discover that David's assertion that their friend was murdered was absolutely correct.</Overview>

    <Overview>Conclusion of this two-part story. Higgins must break the news to Agatha that it's not her that he intends to marry, but he finds that Lady Ashley is not the same as the woman that he thought he knew. Meanwhile, Magnum meets Diane's twin sister Diedre, who claims that her sister is a paranoid hysteric who has been in and out of mental institutions, attempted suicide, and has twice tried to kill her. Diane insists that her sister is the bad one and is just trying to bad-mouth her to put Magnum off of her just as she always has done with Diane's men, and as Magnum tries to find out which of the sisters is telling the truth and just what is going on, he encounters one bizarre twist after another about Diane and Diedre's true identities...</Overview>

    <Overview>At request of Robin Masters, Thomas begrudgingly is to provide protection for a political candidate whom he has reason to dislike. He is also waiting for a female client, but in her place arrives a young Vietnamese boy, Tran Quoc Jones, who wants to hire Magnum to find his long lost father, a pilot in the Vietnam war. Tran cannot go to the authorities for help as he is an illegal immigrant and would face deportation, and as Thomas does his best to trace the boy's father, he and his friends, especially T.C., become attached to the boy. But Magnum learns that the woman who was originally to have hired him was found murdered - and the politician, the dead woman and the young Vietnamese boy all tie in to the same case...</Overview>

    <Overview>Robin's friend and aspiring writer Betty comes to the estate for a quiet place to overcome her case of writer's block as she works on her mystery adventure novel. In short order, she convinces Higgins to hand over the keys to the Ferrari and to relocate Thomas to the main house while she works in the guest house, much to Thomas's extreme displeasure. After Thomas is forced by a lack of transportation to let her observe his investigation of a hit-and-run insurance case, she begins to churn out a story inspired by Thomas's case, featuring Thomas as dashing international investigator Sebastian Sabre, Higgins as his faithful servant Boris, T.C. as his pilot Winston, Rick as club owner Swift, and herself as Sabre's glamorous girlfriend Collette. Her wild imagination unwittingly breaks open Thomas's investigation and plunges them both into danger.</Overview>

At first she thinks that she just may be imagining it, but as the happenings turn more sinister, her fears grow. It seems that the threats are connected with the leader of a religious group that her father, also a District Attorney, sent to prison over fifteen years earlier, whom she is about to testify for parole to be denied. Meanwhile, Higgins is expecting a visit of three old friends from Sandhurst, but he isn't particularly looking forward to the visit...</Overview>

    <Overview>Thomas' luck takes a tumble when he injures his ankle while training for an upcoming charity sports event, and if his foot doesn't heal in time, his place will be taken for the race. But his luck looks set to fall even more when he finds that prostitute Leslie Emery, who he met when he was working as a hotel detective, has now given up working as a call-girl and has recently taken a job as a waitress at the King Kamehameha Club, and wants to hire him to help her find her missing sister, who is also a hooker. Although she is well-meaning, Leslie's 'act now, think later' ways have proven to cause nothing but problems for Thomas, and sure enough, in next to no time they are up to their necks in chaos, as they uncover that Leslie's missing sister is involved with well-known, powerful political figures...</Overview>

    <Overview>Magnum is working on a case before a date with Rick's visiting cousin, when he sees a young native Hawaiian girl become an accidental witness to a murder. With the gun-man after her, Magnum saves the young woman as they escape by diving into the sea, and is injured with a gun-shot wound in the process. He regains consciousness several days later on the remote, secluded island of Kapu, after being rescued by a native fisherman from the island, and suffering from a hazy memory of the incident. There is no sign of the girl, and the island natives insist that he was the only one found. Thomas tries to remember the events that lead to him being on the island, and what has happened to the girl, but as he tries to uncover the secrets of the island and its people, it begins to seem more and more as if they don't want him to find any answers or to leave... Meanwhile, the killer is still looking for the girl, to eliminate her as the only witness to the killing...</Overview>
